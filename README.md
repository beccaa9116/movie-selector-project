# movie-selector-project
let the program choose what you should watch on disney plus

While learning Python I decided to dive into some beginner projects and I stumbled upon a simple selector.
The selector was meant to choose who you should call today. 
That didn't sound like quite a challenge for me so I decided to take it to another level.
I downloaded a bunch of data from internet (lists of all movies and series you can watch on Disney+)
...and got into work to create a selector that will choose a movie or series you should watch today.

The selector contains just a few options you can choose from (e.g. movie/series, animated/live-action)
and then selects a random piece from the list you have chosen.
It is not too advanced since I am just a beginner, but maybe in a future I will get to a point where more options are included.

For now, let's have fun with this one!
